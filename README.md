# NUKE + Docker Image + GitHub Image Registry

This is a simple project utilizing the NUKE automated build system and Docker that serves as an example of how to push Docker Images to the GitHub Image registry.

For testing purposes the image that is used is alpine linux + git as it's small enough for the purpose.
